"""Reactions: what a device listens to, as Home Assistant automations pururu generates.

A reaction is one source (an entity of a device, a real entity, a time of day,
the sun) and, for an entity, a condition. Each becomes an automation in
pururu/automations.yaml, which configuration.yaml includes. It has no actions
yet: it fires, and its trace shows when and why.
